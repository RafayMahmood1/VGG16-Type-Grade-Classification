# Mango Image Classification using VGG16

This repository contains a Python code for image classification of mangoes using the VGG16 model. The aim of the project is to classify the type of mango and its quality based on the image of the mango.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains images of different types of mangoes, including Chasuna, Sindhri, and Anwar Ratool. The dataset also contains images of mangoes of different qualities, such as good quality as GRADE A, average quality as GRADE B, and poor quality as GRADE C.

## VGG16 Model
The VGG16 model is a convolutional neural network that was trained on a large image dataset called ImageNet. The model has 16 layers, including 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. It is a widely used model for image classification tasks due to its high accuracy.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* OpenCV
* NumPy
## Usage
Clone this repository: git clone [https://github.com/rafaymahmood1/vgg16-type-grade-classification.git](https://github.com/RafayMahmood1/VGG16-Type-Grade-Classification.git)
Run the Notebook-VGG16.ipynb file to train the model
## Results
After training the model on the dataset, the accuracy achieved on the test set was around 90%. The model was able to correctly classify the type of mango and its quality based on the image of the mango.
